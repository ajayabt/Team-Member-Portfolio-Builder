# Team-Member-Portfolio-Builder


## Description

This app has been developed to generate a HTML file to represent a team consisting of a manager, and any number of interns or engineers. It runs in the CLI and all the user neds to do is run node index.js, and type their answers in response to the prompts.


## Installation

This app can be run by cloning the repository and navigating to the local directory which contains the index.js file. From here, run 'node index.js'. This will initiate the program to run the prompts in the command line. Respond to the questions, upon completion, the success message will display and the new HTML file can be accessed and opened with a live server to view the outcome.


## Usage

This package can be run using the CLI. See above.




## Credits
We were provided with some starter code to structure the challenge. It included the _tests_ folder as well as lib which indicated the required file structure. Importantly src folder included the required code to render the HTML page. Inquirer is used which provides snippets to aid in deployment. Thanks to the bootcamp instructors and TAs who have enabled me to get this far.
